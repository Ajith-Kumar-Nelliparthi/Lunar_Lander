# 🚀 Lunar Lander - Reinforcement Learning

Welcome to the **Lunar Lander** project! This project implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to solve the OpenAI Gym Lunar Lander environment.

## 📌 Project Overview
Lunar Lander is a physics-based control problem where an agent must land a spacecraft safely on a designated landing pad using thrust controls. The agent is trained using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** to achieve optimal landings.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop an RL-based agent to control the lunar lander.
- Experiment with different RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, A2C).
- Optimize hyperparameters for better performance.
- Deploy the trained model for real-time inference.
